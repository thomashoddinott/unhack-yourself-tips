Personal hacks and habbits to stay unplugged from the matrix

## Phone

Avoid checking social media before noon; from then I try to limit myself to check inbox once every 1/2 hours.

No social media notifications + I use IG with that blocker app

If you just need IG messenger and are having a hard time kicking IG consider https://www.instagram.com/direct/inbox/

Separate phone (simless, connected to wifi) for work which I use to run pomodorro timer and other tasks

In the office I keep my personal phone in my bag 

## Laptop

Multiple browsers

I use a separate browser with this extension to manually toggle my social media usages

Avoid feeds at all costs - use redirector extensions - or bookmark sections of apps (inbox, groups, etc.)

## Brave Browser

Blocks all YT adds on laptop and mobile

Can also play YT videos as podcasts on your phone

## Pomodorro 

25 + 5

Stand up every 25 minutes - do something completely different - prepare a quick salad, stretch, etc.

I still do this in the office but walk to a quiet corner and work through some Anki
